Calculate-band-name-percentage-python
=====================================
I read an article on Invisible Oranges that posted the frequencies of the most used metal band names. I decided to write this Python script that calculates the percentage of each one compared to the overall numer of actual bands. I.E. (number of bands with this name)/(number of total bands)*100. Even though the names seemed high in frequency, given the percentages and the fact that there are countless metal bands, they don't seem that high after all.
